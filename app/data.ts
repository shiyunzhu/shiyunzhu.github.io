The Sphere was built to have the best sound quality of any venue, with a record 167,000 speakers (more than one per seat allowing it to completely customize the sound it sends to each seat). And yet it's perhaps more famous for its 16k x 16k LED screen, the largest and highest-resolution screen in the World. Enjoy the show!",
